## Project Details

The student was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools he had to add a number of entities to the game including the player character and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to pass the hordes of icky bugs, without touching them and reach the river.

* Use **right**, **left**, **up** and **down** arrow keys to move the character.
* Every time the player reaches the river they get a point, try to gather as many as you can.
* The player is in 1/3 a cat and as such possesses 3 lives.
